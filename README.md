## Technologies/Dependencies,
>Node.js :Node. js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications.

>Express.js :Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js 

>EJS  :EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript

>bcrypt :The bcrypt hashing function allows us to build a password security platform that scales with computation power and always hashes every password with a salt

>express-session :Express. js uses a cookie to store a session id (with an encryption signature) in the user's browser and then, on subsequent requests, uses the value of that cookie to retrieve session information stored on the server. It will help in remembering weather a user is logged in or not

>mongoDB : MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage.
